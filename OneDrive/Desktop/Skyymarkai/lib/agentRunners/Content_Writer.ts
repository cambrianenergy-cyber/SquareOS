 * Content Writer Agent - PROFOUND VERSION
 * 
 * This is an advanced content generation system that produces sophisticated,

 * - Psychological triggers and persuasion principles
 * - Platform-specific algorithms and engagement patterns
 * - Storytelling frameworks that convert
 * - Audience psychology and messaging hierarchy
 * - Brand voice consistency across channels
 * 
 * Flow:
 * 1. User describes their idea/goal
 * 2. Agent analyzes for emotional hooks, value props, CTAs
 * 3. Agent picks appropriate template
 * 4. Agent generates sophisticated, conversion-focused content
 * 5. System learns from user's brand voice
 * 6. Agent makes suggestions for next posts

## The Real Story Behind ${userDescription.split(" ")[0]}

When I first started exploring ${userDescription.split(" ").slice(0, 3).join(" ")}, I made every mistake in the book. I thought more effort would equal better results. I was wrong.

After working with hundreds of people and testing dozens of approaches, I discovered what actually works. This guide shares everything I've learned.

## The Problem Most People Miss

${userDescription.substring(0, 300)}

The challenge isn't figuring out what to do. The challenge is doing it consistently, and doing it right.

## Section 1: The Fundamentals
Start here. Most people skip this and wonder why they struggle.

### Key Insight #1: Foundation First
Before you optimize, you need to build the right foundation. This means...

### Key Insight #2: The Psychology Layer
Here's what separates the top 1% from everyone else...

## Section 2: The Strategy
Once you understand the fundamentals, strategy becomes clear.

### Strategic Principle #1
The core lever that moves everything...

### Strategic Principle #2  
Why most strategies fail (and how to avoid it)...

## Section 3: Implementation & Systems
Knowledge without action is just philosophy. Here's the actual system:

- **Week 1**: Foundation setup
- **Week 2-4**: Pattern establishment
- **Month 2+**: Optimization and scale

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Starting with tactics before nailing fundamentals
2. Comparing your beginning to someone else's middle
3. Treating this as a quick fix rather than a system
4. Not tracking what works
5. Perfectionism over progress

## The Bottom Line

${userDescription.substring(userDescription.length - 200)}

The most important thing? Start. Most people never do.

## Ready to Get Started?

The insights in this guide are free. The execution is where most people struggle. The key is to start small, stay consistent, and let compound returns do the work.

Hey there,

I'm sending this today because I want to share something that shifted how I think about ${userDescription.split(" ").slice(0, 3).join(" ")}.

## The Story

${userDescription.substring(0, 300)}

Here's what I realized: Everyone knows what to do. The gap isn't in knowledge—it's in execution.

## Three Insights This Taught Me

**1. The Foundation Always Matters**
Before you optimize anything, you need the basics locked in. Most people skip this step and wonder why they struggle.

**2. Consistency Compounds Exponentially**
Small actions over 100 days beat intense action for 7 days. Every. Single. Time.

**3. The Psychology is 80% of the Game**
You can have the perfect strategy, but if you don't understand the psychology of your audience (or yourself), nothing works.

## What This Means For You

${userDescription.substring(userDescription.length - 200)}

The opportunity here is real. But only if you take action.

## The Call to Action

${includeCTA ? 'Reply to this email with one insight you\'ve had recently. I read and respond to every message (seriously—send something and you\'ll hear back from me).' : 'What\'s one thing you\'re working on that this applies to? Let me know.'}

Hi [Name],

I was thinking about ${userDescription.split(" ").slice(0, 2).join(" ")} today and wanted to reach out.

Here's the thing: ${userDescription.substring(0, 150)}

**Why I'm telling you this:**
You're someone who actually cares about getting results (not just going through the motions). And I've learned that the people who succeed are the ones who can see around the obvious.

**The real insight here:**
Most approaches focus on the wrong variables. They optimize for effort instead of results. They focus on activity instead of impact.

The breakthrough comes when you shift that lens.

**Here's what happens next:**
${userDescription.substring(userDescription.length - 150)}

**My ask:**
${includeCTA ? 'Are you open to exploring this further? Reply with "Yes" and let\'s set up a brief conversation. No pitch—just a genuine conversation about whether this fits what you\'re working on.' : 'What\'s your biggest challenge with this right now? Just hit reply and let me know.'}
